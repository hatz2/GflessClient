1. Open [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler-b) and the Gameforge Client.
2. Enable HTTPS traffic decryption / Tools > Options > HTTPS > Decrypt HTTPS traffic.
3. Connect your game account and copy the blackbox from the request to auth/iovation (the blackbox look something like "tra:JVqc0...")
4. In the Gfless Client go to Options > Identity generator, paste the blackbox and click on the button that says "Generate and save".
5. Save the generated identity to a file.
